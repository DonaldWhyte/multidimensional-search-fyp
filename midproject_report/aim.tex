\subsection{Aim}

This project will survey existing multi-dimensional search structures which attempt to solve the multi-dimensional search problem, identifying the major challenges of the field and how this has guided the development of structures throughout the last two decades. The core aim of the project is to implement one or more modern index structures, optimising them specifically for high-dimensional datasets. These implementation(s) will be then be evaluated with respect to their proposed performance in the literature and pre-defined baselines using test datasets. This evaluation will highlight the found performance bottlenecks in the implementations and limitations of the algorithms themselves.
