\subsection{Objectives}

The objectives of the project are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Understand the current state and challenges of the field of multi-dimensional search
	\item Implement multi-dimensional search structures
	\item Perform performance analysis on implementations and attempt to optimise structures for greater performance on high-dimensional data
	\item Evaluate and compare performance of final structures to pre-defined baselines, unoptimised structures and their reported performance in the literature
\end{itemize}
