Many problems require or benefit from multi-dimensional search, including database querying, computer vision and visualisation. In multi-dimensional search, individual data items are represented as points, vectors or regions in $n$-dimensional space. These are arranged in an indexing structure so relevant data can be retrieved quickly, even when the volume of data is huge.

Since multi-dimensional search is a problem that appears in so many areas in computer science, developing fast, efficient ways of building and querying indexing structures has been the focus of many researchers over the past forty years. Dozens of multi-dimensional search structures have already been developed and there is still much ongoing work toward developing even more efficient search structures.
