After constructing the literature review, deciding an evaluation approach and which structures to implement in Chapters Chapter \ref{chap:background_research}, \ref{chap:evaluation-outline} and \ref{chap:chosen-structures-hypothesis}, implementation began. This section describes the details of each structure's implementation and documents the low-level optimisation efforts than went into accelerating the structures further. Additionally, the implemented structures are evaluated and compared using performance timings and profiling.
