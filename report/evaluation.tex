We have shown that all variations of the $kd$-tree greatly outperform the Pyramid tree for the two scientific datasets. For all synthetic data and the 3D point cloud dataset, the Pyramid tree is faster, especially with regard to point deletion.

This section will explore the reasons for this, determining which characteristics in the data cause the performance of the structures to degenerate. The section will conclude by discussing the types of data suitable for the Pyramid Tree and $kd$-Tree, along with some further discussion on the implications of the results from this evaluation.
