This chapter contains a literature review on multi-dimensional search. First, the problem will be formally defined. Then, the field's core challenges and their implications will be summarised. Existing solutions (data structures) which perform multi-dimensional search will be described, highlighting their limitations with respect to the core challenges. Finally, a discussion on how to choose a structure to a given problem and existing work on parallelising search will be given.
