This chapter contains a literature review of multi-dimensional search. First, the problem will be formally defined. Then, the field's core challenges and their implications will be summarised. Existing multi-dimensional search techniques will be described, highlighting their limitations with respect to the core challenges. A discussion on how to choose a suitable structure for a problem will be given. Finally, the existing work on parallelising search will be summarised.
