    {\LARGE\bf Acknowledgements}
\end{center}

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor David Duke for his invaluable insights during our weekly meetings. His considerable experience in research helped me shape the project's overall evaluation. I would also like thank the project's assessor, Hamish Carr, for stepping in as supervisor while David was unavailable and equally providing useful insight on the project. Karim Djemame has been a fantastic personal tutor throughout the four years of my degree, and I would like to give him thanks for his continuous support.

Further acknowledgements go to Zhao Geng for his initial implementation of an index structure used in the project and fruitful discussion, as well as Elaine Duffin for her useful feedback on the mid-project and final report. I am grateful to my fellow students in the School of Computing for many useful discussions throughout the project, with special thanks to Pavol Kla\u{c}ansk\'{y}.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends. All of these people provided a contribution at some point, whether they patiently listened when I started rambling about the project, or just helped me relax and forget about the project for much needed rest.
