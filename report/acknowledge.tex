First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor David Duke for his invaluable insights during our weekly meetings. His considerable experience in research helped me shape the project's overall evaluation. I would also like thank the project's assessor, Hamish Carr, for stepping in as supervisor while David was unavailable and equally providing useful insight on the project.

I would also like to thank  Zhao Geng for his initial implementation of the Pyramid Tree and fruitful discussion on the project, as well as Elaine Duffin for her useful feedback on the mid-project report. I am grateful to my fellow students in the School of Computing for many useful discussions throughout the project, with special thanks to Pavol Kla\u{c}ansk\'{y}.

% TODO: Gareth Morgan and Alban Smith (extend thanks) -- WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends. All of these people provided a contribution at some point, whether they patiently listened when I started rambling about the project, or just helped me relax and forget about the project for much needed rest.
