\section[Overview]{An Overview of using the Thesis \LaTeX\ Templates}

This report has been written in \LaTeX\ according to the template
provided by M\"{u}ller~\cite{FYP:2001}. Full acknowledgement should also be
given to the originators of the PhD latex template which is the basis
for this template. Also thanks to Matthew Hubbard for the Mathsy
stuff!

This is my first chapter. See Figure~\ref{fig_one} for an example figure.
Note that this text should be one and a half line spacing (see the 
\verb/\onehalfspacing/ command in \url{FYP.tex}) and 11 point font.
